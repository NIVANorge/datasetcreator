# Dataexport

A small program to create Climate and forecast datasets with xarray and save to various formats.

## Local development

See [config.py](./dataexport/config.py) for variables to add to your `.env` file, also, if using your own gcloud account you can export the credentials with this command `export PGPASSWORD=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)`
